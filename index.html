    <!-- ===== INTRODUCTION ===== -->

    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on
        creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that usually require
        human intelligence. AI helps machines to think, learn, and make decisions like humans.

    <!-- ===== DETAILED CONTENT ===== -->

    <h2>Detailed Explanation of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is one of the most advanced and rapidly growing technologies
        in the modern world. It enables machines to perform tasks that normally require
        human intelligence such as learning from data, recognizing patterns, understanding
        natural language, and making decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI systems work by combining large amounts of data with intelligent algorithms.
        These algorithms allow machines to learn from experience, improve performance over time,
        and provide accurate results with minimal human intervention.
    </p>

    <h2>How Artificial Intelligence Works</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence works through the use of data, algorithms, and computational power.
        First, data is collected from various sources. Then machine learning models are trained
        using this data. Over time, these models improve their accuracy by learning from mistakes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technologies such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks,
        and Natural Language Processing play a major role in building AI systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is important because it reduces human effort, saves time,
        and increases efficiency. AI helps organizations automate repetitive tasks,
        analyze large datasets, and make better decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Scope of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
        In the coming years, Artificial Intelligence will play a major role in smart cities,
        autonomous vehicles, advanced healthcare systems, space research, and robotics.
